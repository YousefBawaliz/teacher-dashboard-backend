# Backend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for migrating from mock data to a Flask API backend for the Teacher Dashboard application. The backend will provide API endpoints for authentication, class management, course management, and student views.

## Core Components

### 1. Application Structure
The backend will follow a modular structure with separate components for models, API endpoints, schemas, and utilities. This structure promotes maintainability and separation of concerns.

### 2. Database Design
- SQLite database for development (easily migrated to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production)
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- Flask-Migrate for database migrations

### 3. Authentication System
- Session-based authentication using Flask-Login
- Password hashing for security
- Role-based access control (teacher vs student)

### 4. API Design
- RESTful API design principles
- Flask-Smorest for API development
- JSON response format
- Proper error handling and status codes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up folder structure
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create virtual environment
   - Install required packages

2. **Configuration Setup**
   - Create configuration classes for different environments (development, testing, production)
   - Set up environment variables
   - Configure Flask application
   - Configure database connection
   - Set up CORS for cross-origin requests

3. **Application Factory Pattern**
   - Implement Flask application factory
   - Register extensions (SQLAlchemy, Migrate, Login, CORS)
   - Set up API with Flask-Smorest

### Phase 2: Database Models

1. **User Model**
   - Implement user class with teacher/student roles
   - Set up password hashing and verification
   - Implement Flask-Login integration

2. **Class Model**
   - Implement class representation
   - Set up relationship with teachers and students

3. **Course Model**
   - Implement course with attributes like title, description, date
   - Set up difficulty rating and total marks
   - Create relationship with teacher (creator)

4. **Association Models**
   - Implement ClassCourse association for many-to-many relationship
   - Implement ClassStudent association for many-to-many relationship

5. **Database Migrations**
   - Set up initial migration
   - Create database tables

### Phase 3: Authentication Implementation

1. **Login System**
   - Implement login endpoint with email/password validation
   - Create session management
   - Return user details on successful login

2. **Logout System**
   - End user session
   - Clear session cookies

3. **Session Checking**
   - Implement endpoint to check if user is logged in
   - Return current user details if authenticated

4. **Access Control**
   - Implement decorators for role-based access control
   - Restrict endpoints based on user role

### Phase 4: API Endpoints Implementation

1. **Class Endpoints**
   - Get all classes for the logged-in teacher/student
   - Get details of a specific class with students and courses
   - Get students in a class
   - Get courses assigned to a class
   - Add a course to a class
   - Remove a course from a class

2. **Course Endpoints**
   - Get all courses created by the logged-in teacher
   - Create a new course
   - Get details of a specific course
   - Update a course
   - Delete a course

3. **Student Endpoints**
   - Get all courses for the logged-in student

### Phase 5: Serialization and Schemas

1. **User Schema**
   - Define schema for user serialization
   - Exclude sensitive information (password)

2. **Class Schema**
   - Define schema for class serialization
   - Create nested schema with relationships (courses, students)

3. **Course Schema**
   - Define schema for course serialization
   - Include all course attributes

4. **Request Validation**
   - Implement validation for incoming request data
   - Provide meaningful error messages for invalid data

### Phase 6: Error Handling and Middleware

1. **Error Handlers**
   - Implement global error handling
   - Format error responses consistently

2. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Implement middleware for checking authentication
   - Handle unauthenticated requests

3. **Logging**
   - Set up logging for application events and errors

### Phase 7: Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test model functionality
   - Test authentication system

2. **API Tests**
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Test authorization and permissions

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test integration with frontend
   - Test end-to-end workflows

### Phase 8: Data Seeding

1. **Initial Data**
   - Create seed data for testing
   - Add sample users, classes, and courses

2. **Database Fixtures**
   - Create fixtures for testing

## API Endpoints Specification

### Authentication
- `POST /api/login` - User login
- `POST /api/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/IsLoggedIn` - Check login status

### Classes
- `GET /api/classes` - Get all classes for the logged-in user
- `GET /api/classes/{id}` - Get details of a specific class
- `GET /api/classes/{id}/students` - Get students in a class
- `GET /api/classes/{id}/courses` - Get courses assigned to a class
- `POST /api/classes/{id}/courses` - Add a course to a class
- `DELETE /api/classes/{id}/courses/{course_id}` - Remove a course from a class

### Courses
- `GET /api/courses` - Get all courses created by the logged-in teacher
- `POST /api/courses` - Create a new course
- `GET /api/courses/{id}` - Get details of a specific course
- `PUT /api/courses/{id}` - Update a course
- `DELETE /api/courses/{id}` - Delete a course

### Students
- `GET /api/student/courses` - Get all courses for the logged-in student

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Secure password storage with hashing
   - CSRF protection
   - Session security

2. **Authorization**
   - Proper access control based on user roles
   - Validate ownership of resources

3. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all input data
   - Prevent SQL injection through ORM

4. **CORS Configuration**
   - Configure CORS for secure cross-origin requests
   - Limit allowed origins in production

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Different settings for development and production

2. **Database Migration**
   - Use Flask-Migrate for database schema changes
   - Version control database schema

3. **Production Server**
   - Use Gunicorn or uWSGI in production
   - Set up proper logging

4. **Integration with Frontend**
   - Update frontend API services to use actual endpoints
   - Handle authentication state in frontend

## Frontend Integration Notes

When migrating from mock data to actual API:

1. Update API service files to make actual HTTP requests
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Update authentication flow
4. Handle loading states during API calls
5. Implement token/session management

## Timeline

1. Phase 1-2: 2-3 days
2. Phase 3-4: 3-4 days
3. Phase 5-6: 2-3 days
4. Phase 7-8: 2-3 days

Total estimated time: 9-13 days for complete implementation
